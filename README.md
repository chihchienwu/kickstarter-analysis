# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project

The Kickstarter analysis is performed via request from Louise, a young entrepreneur who launched a Kickstarter for a workshop production of ‘Fever’ back in June 2016. Although the campaign initially garnered a welcoming support from her close family and friends, it came just short of the initial campaign goal of $2,885 due to lack of public backing.

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to help provide appropriate comparison that Louise can compared her campaign, the production of ‘Fever’. Through this analysis, Louise would gain greater understanding about whether her decision to launch the Kickstarter in June played a favorable/unfavorable role in her campaign outcome. Additionally, she would be able to understand whether her campaign goal is a realistic chance of potentially reaching its target.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Out of 1,369 Theater related Kickstarter campaigns launched between 2009 and 2017, 457, or 33% were launched during the period May-Jul. While our preconceived notion made lead us to expect lower success rate due to higher competition within the theater campaign category, the result actually suggests otherwise: May-Jul posted the highest average success rate (65%) for any consecutive three-month period. For us, it indicates a public interest and positive demand for theater related campaign during the summer season.
